# VL 1st Inputs and Outputs Notes

#5 What is an input
#A way for the code to get information 

#6 What is the purpose of inputs
#Code isn't helpful if it doesn't use new information
name = input("What is your name: ")
# ^      ^             ^
# Save the input where it can be accessed again
# Use keyword "input"
# Inside parens give user instructions

print("What is your name?")
name = input()

#Both instruction methods work, but you have to do it the same way all the time in your code

print("Hello",name)
